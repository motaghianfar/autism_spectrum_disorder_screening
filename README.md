# Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening

A Python implementation for predicting autism spectrum disorder using machine learning and explainable AI techniques.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repository contains code for screening and predicting autism based on behavioral and demographic features. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model training (using LightGBM and classical ML models)  
- Model evaluation and plotting  
- Explainable AI / interpretation with SHAP  
- Visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)

The main script is `autism_prediction_2025.py`.
